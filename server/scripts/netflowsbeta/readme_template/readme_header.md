# NetFlows
plugin for OpenNetBattle servers, this plugin lets you create all kinds of interactions on your server without directly writing any code.

[OpenNetBattle server repo](https://github.com/TheMaverickProgrammer/Scriptable-OpenNetBattle-Server)

### example uses
*most of these are not possible yet, but this is the vision*
- trigger a cutscene with all the movements and events defined in the map editor.
- every 10 seconds spawn a bot which follows a path until the end where it despawns
- add simple interact text to objects âœ…
- when a player joins the server, send them to a particular location
- when a player presses R, open a menu BBS with many options, trigger any action when any of these are selected.

The plan is that we should be able to do 90% of what the scriptable server is capabile of, without writing any code.

### Installation
simply copy the `netflows` folder into your server folder, eg: `server/scripts/netflows`

### Usage
#### tiled setup
*note, the following instructions are not correct yet, currently the tile definitions are in the example server.tiled-project in the `onb-server-template` ezlibs2 branch*

import the custom types from `netflows/custom_types` into your tiled edtior from the toolbar **view** -> **custom types** -> **import**

this will give you a complete list of all the classes supported by this library, when you create a object in tiled you will be able to select a class

#### process
TBD

#### examples
have a look at the maps files in this [git repository](https://github.com/Keristero/onb-server-template/tree/ezlibs2)
you could follow the steps download and run it as an example too.
